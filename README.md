# Invoice Generator

### WHY?
This app makes it easy to create and send invoices with just one click

### HOW?
Once you wrote your compnay's info, you choose a template for your invoices, then when sending an invoice, you register the other company as a receipent, after writing the tasks that you've done with their amount, the everything is calculated for you including taxes, then just click send and it will send the invoice to the other company and yourself.
That does not seem like one click?
The next invoice is one click, you already have your company, template, the other company, the rest is write your tasks and send next time.
